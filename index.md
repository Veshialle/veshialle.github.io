## About
This blog is probably a huge hole and a waste of time.
Let's first point, we need to write more and I have no shame to write down some part of my life

## About, Further
My main role in this life is being the SOC Manager in the third level of Cyberoo and Co - SOC Coordinator for the first and second level.
With this role, except for the obvious operational work, me and my team need to support Research&Development team in order to define new features, new detections.

Occasionally I ride my bike for dirty adventures, I play boring video games and I'm a homelabber enthusiast.
